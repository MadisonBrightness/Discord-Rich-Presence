## What is Discord RPC? 🐱‍🏍

Discord RPC is a library for interfacing your game with a locally running Discord desktop client.

## How does it work? ✨

There is an API that communicates between your game and discord client to set a user's game activity, therefore by displaying the details of what the developers of that particular game have programmed. You need to have and run discord's local client in order for RPC's to work.
